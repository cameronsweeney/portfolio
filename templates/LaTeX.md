Why LaTeX?
+ [LATEX for Word Processor Users](https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/info/latex4wp/latex4wp.pdf)
    > First of all, let me state that this is not a LATEX primer! If you’re reading this document, I
assume that you have at least a basic understanding of LATEX and of its basic commands.
In this guide, I’ll explain how to replace a word processor effectively using LATEX.
Word processors are the ‘killer app’ in modern office automation. They’re perceived to be
easier than LATEX as they have a friendly WYSIWYG interface, and the average secretary
will learn to use them in a relatively short time. The problem is, these beasts keep growing
slow, bloated, buggy, crash-prone, expensive, virus ridden, and incompatible with each
other. Not to talk about their default output quality.
LATEX is an excellent alternative (in some cases, it is the only viable alternative); but it’s
not much intuitive for those accustomed to WYSIWYG.

List of helpful packages:
+ `siunitx`: https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx?lang=en
+ `babel`: language-specific typesetting
+ `booktabs`: https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/booktabs.pdf
   > "Publication-quality tables" -- seems like a good place to learn how to make neat tables

+ etc.

Linguistics:
+ `gb4e` for numbered + glossed examples
+ `pst-asr` for typesetting autosegmental representations
+ `tipaman` for typesetting IPA powerfully and fully

TikZ stuff:
+ `\usetikzlibrary{3d}`: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/75945/documentation-of-the-tikz-3d-library
    + Not really documented in PGF/TikZ manual.
    + Also watch out for some error somewhere - there's a bug in one of the 3d macros

Please excuse the rubble while everything's still under construction!
